    %p.headline I'm a NY/NJ based, full stack web developer.  I currently work at <a href="http://www.canvas.is" target="_blank">Canvas</a>, as a Lead Full Stack Engineer.  I specialize in front end optimization including writing high performance JavaScript applications. My languages of choice are JavaScript and Ruby.

    %p I am passionate about web development as a whole and believe in clean organized code. I aim to ensure that the user has the smoothest experience possible while on the web, as well as pushing the boundaries on web development. In my spare time I enjoy working on various side projects, including my work on the <a href="http://gradients.glrzad.com">CSS3 Gradient Generator</a>. I've also begun learning iOS development and Objective C.

My passions lie in building applications from either end of the development spectrum.
