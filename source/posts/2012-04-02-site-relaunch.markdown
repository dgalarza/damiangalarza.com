Welcome to the overhaul of my site. I've migrated over from glrzad.com and Wordpress to a custom built CMS, built using Ruby on Rails. For more info head over to the <a href="/about">About</a> section for more details. I'm aiming to keep more active on here than before logging my work and experiments more often.

## Work

Along with the my site refresh there are a few other projects that are in the works, some new and some old.

### <a href="http://www.css3factory.com" class="alt-anchor">CSS Factory</a>

I've begun work on my newest project, the <a href="http://www.css3factory.com">CSS3 Factory</a>. I plan on building out a suite of tools for live CSS3 testing and more so stay tuned.

### <a href="http://gradients.glrzad.com" class="alt-anchor">CSS3 Gradient Generator</a>

The CSS3 Gradient Generator is also in the midst of getting an overhaul. As part of building up the CSS3 Factory, I will be moving the CSS3 Gradient Generator to live as part of the CSS3 Factory.
